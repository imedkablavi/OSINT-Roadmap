# 🔍 OSINT Roadmap: Practical & Ethical Open Source Intelligence

![OSINT Banner](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555949963-aa79dcee981c)

Welcome to a practical field guide for **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**.  
This repository is **not a tool dump**. It is a disciplined methodology built on
critical thinking, legal compliance, and evidence-based analysis.

This roadmap is written from a practitioner’s perspective for those who want to
move beyond casual searching and develop **professional, defensible OSINT skills**.

---

## 1. Understanding OSINT: Beyond the Search Bar

OSINT is the structured process of collecting, evaluating, and analyzing
**publicly available information**—whether free or commercially accessible—to
answer a clearly defined intelligence question.

OSINT is not about *finding information*.
It is about **proving whether information is true, relevant, and reliable**.

### Real-World Applications

OSINT underpins modern digital investigations across multiple domains:

- **Digital & Cyber Investigations**  
  Identifying threat actors, mapping exposed infrastructure, and tracking
  malicious campaigns using publicly observable data.

- **Investigative Journalism**  
  Verifying images and videos (GEOINT), confirming timelines, and uncovering
  corporate or governmental misconduct.

- **Due Diligence & Risk Analysis**  
  Assessing individuals, companies, and partnerships for financial, legal, or
  reputational risk.

- **Media & Disinformation Analysis**  
  Determining the origin, time, and authenticity of viral content.

## 2. OSINT vs. Hacking or Espionage: A Non-Negotiable Boundary

> **OSINT is observation, not intrusion.**

| Aspect | OSINT (Ethical & Legal) | Hacking / Espionage (Illegal) |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Access | Publicly available data | Private or protected systems |
| Technique | Passive collection | Active exploitation |
| Permission | Allowed by law & ToS | Unauthorized access |
| Risk | Low legal exposure | Criminal liability |

**If accessing the data requires bypassing authentication, violating ToS,
or exploiting a vulnerability — it is not OSINT.**

A professional OSINT analyst operates strictly within legal and ethical limits.

## 3. Why OSINT Matters

OSINT is a **foundational skill** in the information age.

### Value Across Disciplines

- **Cybersecurity:** External attack surface mapping and threat intelligence  
- **Journalism:** Evidence-based reporting and verification  
- **Software & Product Research:** Market intelligence and competitive analysis  
- **Policy & Research:** Contextual understanding using verifiable sources  

### Common Beginner Errors

1. Tool obsession instead of methodology  
2. Confirmation bias  
3. Poor OPSEC (revealing identity to targets)  
4. Treating raw data as conclusions

## 4. The Learning Stages (Roadmap)

### Phase I – Foundations (Mindset)

- Analytical thinking
- Asking the *right* questions
- Source evaluation (CRAAP test)
- Legal frameworks (GDPR, privacy laws)
- Ethics and researcher responsibility

---

### Phase II – Core OSINT Skills (Techniques)

- **Advanced Search:** Boolean logic, operators, niche search engines  
- **SOCMINT:** Behavioral patterns, identity correlation  
- **Image & Video Verification:** Metadata, shadows, landmarks  
- **Relationship Mapping:** Linking entities without assumptions

### Phase III – OSINT Workflow (Process)

![Workflow Diagram](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526378722484-bd91ca387e72)

1. Define the **Priority Intelligence Requirement (PIR)**
2. Select appropriate public sources
3. Collect data using clean OPSEC environments
4. Verify and triangulate findings
5. Archive evidence (screenshots, hashes, timestamps)
6. Document methodology
7. Produce an intelligence report

---

## 5. Tools: Purpose Before Technology

Tools support methodology — they never replace it.

| Category | Purpose | Legal Boundary |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Search Engines | Surface discovery | No login bypass |
| Social Media | Public profile analysis | Respect platform ToS |
| Images & Video | Verification | No biometric misuse |
| Infrastructure | Domain & hosting intel | No active scanning |
| Archiving | Evidence preservation | Public content only |

---

## 6. Learning Resources

### Free Video Resources
- Non-profit investigative organizations
- Open university lectures
- Documented OSINT investigations

Focus on **process**, not outcomes.

### Written Resources
- Academic papers on intelligence analysis
- Government OSINT manuals
- Threat intelligence reports

---

## 7. Certifications: Skill vs Credential

### Free Certifications
- Foundational concepts
- Ethics and terminology
- Best for beginners

### Paid Certifications
- Structured, scenario-based training
- Valuable for professional validation
- Focus on **analysis & reporting**, not tools alone

---

## 8. OSINT Case Example (Methodology Focus)

**Scenario:** Verifying the claimed location of a viral video.

**Methodology:**
- Identify unique landmarks
- Cross-reference satellite imagery
- Analyze shadows using solar data
- Validate against claimed timeline

**Conclusion Example:**
> Location verified with high confidence; temporal claim remains unverified due
> to inconsistent shadow orientation.

---

## 9. Reporting: Where Intelligence Is Created

A professional report includes:

- Clear objective
- Verified sources
- Evidence-backed findings
- Confidence levels
- Explicit limitations

**Opinion is not intelligence. Evidence is.**

---

## 10. Ethics, Law & Responsibility

### Permitted
- Public data collection
- Lawful archiving
- Privacy-respecting analysis

### Forbidden
- Social engineering
- Doxxing
- Active probing or scanning

**If private data is collected accidentally, it must be deleted and documented.**

Professional credibility in OSINT is built on restraint, not reach.

---

### Final Note
OSINT is not about knowing everything.  
It is about **knowing what can be proven — and what cannot**.
