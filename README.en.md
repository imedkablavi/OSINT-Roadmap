## 🔍 What is OSINT?

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is the structured process of:

> Collecting, verifying, analyzing, and reporting  
> **publicly available information** to answer a defined intelligence question.

OSINT is **not about finding information**.  
OSINT is about **proving what is true**.

Public sources include:
- Websites & blogs
- Social media (public content only)
- Images & videos
- Public records
- Domains, IPs, certificates, metadata

## ⚖️ OSINT vs Hacking (Legal Boundaries)

![Legal vs Illegal](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589829545856-d10d557cf95f)

> **OSINT = Observation, not intrusion**

| Aspect | OSINT (Legal) | Hacking (Illegal) |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| Data Access | Public data | Private systems |
| Technique | Passive | Active exploitation |
| Authentication | No bypass | Bypass / cracking |
| Risk | Low | Criminal liability |

❌ If it requires:
- Bypassing login
- Fake accounts
- Violating Terms of Service
- Exploiting vulnerabilities  

➡️ **It is NOT OSINT**

## 🎯 Who This Roadmap Is For

✔ Beginners starting from zero  
✔ Cybersecurity & Threat Intelligence learners  
✔ Journalists & fact-checkers  
✔ Researchers & investigators  
✔ Anyone who wants **defensible OSINT skills**

---

## 🔁 OSINT Workflow

![Workflow](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526378722484-bd91ca387e72)

1. Define intelligence question (PIR)
2. Select public sources
3. Collect data (clean OPSEC)
4. Verify & triangulate
5. Archive evidence
6. Analyze findings
7. Write intelligence report

---

## 🧰 Tools (Purpose Before Technology)

| Category | Purpose | Rule |
|--------|--------|------|
| Search engines | Surface discovery | No bypass |
| Social media | Public profile analysis | Respect ToS |
| Images & video | Verification | No biometric abuse |
| Domains & infra | Passive intelligence | No active scanning |
| Archiving | Evidence preservation | Public content only |

> Tools support methodology — they never replace it.

---

## 📍 Case Study Example

**Scenario:** Verifying a viral video location.

**Steps:**
1. Identify landmarks
2. Compare with satellite imagery
3. Analyze shadows
4. Check weather & timeline
5. Cross-reference local sources

**Conclusion Example:**
> Location verified with high confidence.  
> Timeline remains unverified due to inconsistent shadow angles.

---

## 📝 Reporting & Documentation

A professional OSINT report includes:
- Objective
- Sources
- Methodology
- Findings
- Confidence level
- Limitations

**Opinion is not intelligence. Evidence is.**

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

- Tool obsession
- Confirmation bias
- Poor OPSEC
- Treating raw data as conclusions
- Ignoring legal boundaries
